echo "Demo complete!"
echo "Files created:"
echo "- signed.txt (cryptographically signed contract)"
echo "- tampered.txt (modified version for testing)"
echo "- extracted.txt (original text extracted from signed version)"
echo "- tampered_content.txt (the modified content)"
echo "- private_key.pem, public_key.pem (legitimate cryptographic keys)"
echo "- fake_key.pem, fake_public.pem (attacker's keys - different signatures)"

echo "Key insight: Even if an attacker modifies the content and re-signs it"
echo "with their own key, the original signature verification will fail,"
echo "proving the document has been tampered with!"
